The analysis of mosquito data is carried out in a series of stages

We use the susceptibility bioassay test as a proxy for pyrethroid resistance in local mosquitoes
This is a widely used assay with many data collated

We use experimental hut assays for data on the probability of mosquitoes dying on each feeding attempt.
The above two assays and associations are reviewed in Nash et al. 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crpvbd.2021.100047)

A subsequent analysis finds that predictive performance of the transmission model is better with the log-logistic function
Sherrard-Smith et al. in press (Nat Communs 2022)

Part 1: Fit a log-logistic function to the mortality data

Part 2: Define the additional benefit from next-generation mosquito nets
This is those with something additional to pyrethroid-only active ingredients.
We explore pyrethroid-PBO nets and pyrethroid-pyrrole nets

Part 3: Define the associations between the probable outcomes of mosquito feeding attempts.
How mosquito mortality as measured in an experimental hut predicts deterrence
How mosquito mortality as measured in an experimental hut predicts successful feeding

Part 4: We refit the half life parameters following 
Churcher et al (2016) (DOI: 10.7554/eLife.16090) given a limitation that we do not have information on how washing relates to durability in the field for any newer net type, we do this for pyrethroid only nets and apply the same assumption to all nets. This will be updated when new data are avaialable and represents a key limitation currently.

Part 5: Draw these information together to estimate parameters for the transmission model coded in malariasimulation.


Validation: The validation folder uses malariasimulation to simulate recent randomised control trials testing the epidemiological benefit of mosquito nets. We show how closely the parameterisations are able to predict the observed empirical data
