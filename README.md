# Mosq-Net-Efficacy
Public Repo for mosquito net statistical analysis to determine model parameters for malariasimulation
For validations as updated for net use drop off, and described in publication, please see
https://github.com/IsaacStopard/RCT_prediction

To estimates ITN efficacy parameters for the malariasimulation model, Run through:
"R code/Part 5 Parameter determination median.R"

We are currently updating estimates for the durability of each type of mosquito net
We advise the use of pyrethroid-only ITN gamman for pyrethroid-pyrrole ITNs in the
absence of further data. This is likely a conservative estimate of the efficacy of the
pyrethroid-pyrrole ITN.

The most recent ITN efficacy parameters are stored in the:
"parameters" folder
